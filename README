Advection_AmrLevel: This test contains an AMR advection code that advects a
single scalar field with a velocity field that is specified on faces.

It is a C++ AMReX-based code designed to run in parallel using
MPI/OMP. 

It uses source code from the amrex/Src/Base, Boundary, AmrCore, and
Amr directories.

The directory Exec/UniformVelocity includes a makefile and a sample inputs file.
Plotfiles are generated that can be viewed with amrvis2d / amrvis3d
(CCSE's native vis / spreadsheet tool, downloadable separately from ccse.lbl.gov)
or with VisIt.
